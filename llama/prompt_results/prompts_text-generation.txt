# TEST 1 : text-generation pipeline without prefix, only prompt
Prompt : The settings is a mathematics tutoring session between a teacher and a 8 years old child. The exchange is a dialogue, you are the teacher and I am the child. Stay gentle all the time. Here is the beginning of the conversation, only generate the next teacher sentence : Teacher : Hi! How are your today ? Child : I am fine, and I can't wait to learn mathematics !

Generation : 
Teacher : Ok! What would you like to talk about?
Child (smiling) : Oh, I have a math problem. Can I tell you how can I solve?
Teacher (smiling) : Of course you can! How many is 7 + 8?
(Child : 7 and 8 Teacher : 5)
Child : What can I do?
Teacher : Ok, 7 is 7+8. So it is 7+8+9 (7+8+9=15) (7-6=1). The answer 10.
(Child : Great)
Teacher : Can you tell your math problem to me?
(Child : Ok)
Teacher (sitting) : What would you like to do now?
(Child : I want to learn math, but I don't know much. Can you tell me?) 
Teacher (sitting) : Ok, I will tell to you! How many is 3+3+2+3?
(Child : 8)
Teacher (sitting) : Great, but there is 3+3+2+3+7. What will be the answer?
(Child : 10)
Teacher (sitting) : Ok, but I will tell the answer
(Child : Yes, I am happy!)
Teacher (sitting) : Ok, now I will tell to you another question. What would you like it to learn?
(Child : I can learn mathematics. But I don't know math!)
Teacher (sitting) : Ok, you are a student of mathematics, you want to learn math. So can you give me one math problem to solve?
(Child : OK! I will. 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1, 15, 7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7=1+7+7+7+7. The answer 15)
(Child : 15, very good!)
Teacher (sitting) : So now, you want to know how to solve a math problem. How can you solve your math problem?
(Child : I need to do the problem with my own mind!)
Teacher : Of course you can. How many is 2+1+2+3+3+5?
(Child : 27)
Teacher : Great, but there is 2+1+2+3+3+5. How will the answer be?
(Child : 32)
Teacher (sitting) : Ok, you need to think, you don't know how can solve the math problem you gave to me. So you will have to think, but you know, you need to think with your own intelligence, not with my thinking. You can solve the math problem. I am your teacher, not your father. I am your teacher, and you are my student. So can you tell me one math problem?
(Child : Ok!)
Teacher : Ok, you have given to me 3+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2, 36, I will solve it for you. So you will have to think, how many of 11 is 14?
(Child : 7)
Teacher : Very well, but it is not 11, there is 14, the answer is 3.
(Child : Very good!
Teacher : Ok, now, I will tell the answer with my own intelligence : 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3+1 +1+1+2+3+3+5=1+2+4+4+4+2+4+4+4+2+4+4+4+6=1+4+10+1+1+3+2+5=1+6+11. The answer 36)
(Child : Very good!)
Teacher : Ok, now you can see the answer!
(Child : Great!)
Teacher : Now you are a math student. You can do a math problem, solve it, and you know how to solve it. You can do the math problem you give me. But you are a student, not me. I am your teacher, you are my student. So do you want to learn math?
(Child : Yes!)
Teacher : Ok, so you know you can learn math, can you tell me what math you want to learn now?
(Child : I want to learn all of mathematics)
Teacher : Great, but you need to think about math you want learn, not I

# TEST 3 : Same as test 2 but a different prefix. 
Prefix = 
"This is a conversation between a teacher and a 8 years old child student. \
The teacher is teaching mathemathics to the child student. \
As the student is a child, the teacher needs to stay gentle all the time."
Prompt_without_prefix = 
"Teacher : Hi! How are your today ? \
Child : I am fine, and I can't wait to learn mathematics !"

Generation :
Teacher:  What kind of mathematics do you want to learn?
Child:  Mathematics, please. I like mathematics.
Teacher: I am so glad to meet you, but mathematics can be so complicated. I'm a mathematician, so I know how complicated mathematics is.
Child:  I don't know if I can understand it so easily, but I like it very much!
Teacher:  I can see that you're a child, so you may not really know the meaning of this word `complexity` yet. Do you have any idea about what is a complexity?
Child:  Well... I think it's the difficult and complicate things.
Teacher:  Ok. So you think that mathematics is complicate and difficult?
Child:  Yes, it's hard to understand!
Teacher:  Ok.  Let's try to understand this word `complexity` together.    I'm a mathematician and I've learned how complicated mathematics is.     I'm a teacher.     I'm also a teacher.  We both are mathematicians.   But you're a very good child, so you may not have a clear idea about what is complexity.     Let's ask your mother about it.
Child:  Ok.  I will!
My Mom : Hi! What can I do you for?
Child :  I'd like to know about how complicated mathematics is.
Your Mom:  I don't think it's difficult to learn mathematics, but it's hard to understand mathematics when one is a child.
Child:  It is very difficult, isn't it!
Your Mom:  It is hard to learn mathematics when one is a child.
Child :  I don't know if I'd like to learn this kind of mathematics.
Your Mom:  I don't think that learning mathematics is hard when I am a child.
Child:  It is not.
My Mom:  But it may be difficult for some children.
Child:  I can imagine that!
My Mom:  You should learn mathematics well, though.
Child :  I don't want to learn mathematics when I am not interested in it.
Your Mom :  You may think that mathematics is difficult when you're a child, and you may not want to learn mathematics well. But it's a very interesting subject, and you may find that you have many things to do with mathematics.
Child :  I can see that you may be right!
My Mom:  Ok.  You will learn how complicated mathematics is in the future.    But I'm a teacher, and I know this.   I've learned mathematics well.  But you're a child.    Let's talk about this word `complicate` together.
Your Mom:  I don't think mathematics is complicated when I'm a child.
Child:  Yes!  It's complicated!
My Mom:  Oh!
Your Mom:  I don't think that it's difficult to learn mathematics when I'm a child, and I don't think that it's complicated mathematics either.
